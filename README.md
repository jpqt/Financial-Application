* [json](https://github.com/topics/json?l=python) - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standard file format that uses text to communicate data objects to array data types. This notation makes it easy for applications to parse and generate files. JSON grew out of the need to have a real-time server-to-web browser communication.

* [MCsimulation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp) - Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.
